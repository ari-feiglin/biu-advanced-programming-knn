# BIU Advanced Programming Assignment Submission
**Ari Feiglin, Gal Nemetsky**

## General Structure

The project is split into three main directories:

+ **The `include` folder** - 
    The `include` folder holds all of the header files that have been used in this project.
    Some of the headers, for example `knn-algo.h`, hold implementations for template methods or other things that should be implemented in header files (`knn-algo.h` holds an implementation for the quick select algorythm for a vector and in `misc.h` there is an implemetation for an array we used in other parts of the project).
+ **The `lib` folder** - 
    In the `lib` folder we have `.cpp` files that implement the independent part of the project, meaning, implementations that are independent of the actual program and are meant to be reused in other parts of the project. 
+ **The `src` folder** - 
    In the `src` folder we have `.cpp` files that implement all of the program-dependent part of the project, that includes the `main` and other program-dependent processes.
